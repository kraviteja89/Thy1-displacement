This code is used for data analysis for the paper  
"Functional hyperemia drives fluid exchange in the paravascular space" by Kedarasetti et. al. 
https://doi.org/10.1186/s12987-020-00214-3

All the code in this repository works with MatlabÂ® 2019 (Mathworks Inc.)

To analyze the image files and calculate the displacements run the file "Thy1_analysis_summary.m"
The information about the datasets should be stored in an excelsheet with the following columns:
Animal ID; Day ID ;File Number;Pixel Scale

All the data including the excel files is available upon request. Please email raviteja(_at_)psu(dot)edu (or) pjd17(_at_)psu(dot)edu

The resulting displacements calculated from running this file are manually verified using ImageJ and the locations are added to the excel file. 

The displacement_summary.m file is run to calculate the mean and standard deviation of normalized impulse responses (Fig 5n)
